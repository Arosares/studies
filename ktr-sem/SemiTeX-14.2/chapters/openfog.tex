\subsection{The OpenFog Consortium}

The OpenFog Consortium is a composite of multiple big players founded in 2015 in order to solve challenges the usual and wide-spread, centralized cloud architecture could not handle.
The founding members were Arm, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft and the Princeton University. Right now there are 55 members and the consortium is getting larger as more organizations realize the potential of the Fog Architecture.
