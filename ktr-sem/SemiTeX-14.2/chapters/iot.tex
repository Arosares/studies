\section{Fog and IoT}

\subsection{Rising Challenges of IoT}
The Internet of Things is a very promising but also very criticised field.
Approximately 17 - 30 billion IoT devices are assumed to be online by 2020\footnote{http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/telecom/internet/popular-internet-of-things-forecast-of-50-billion-devices-by-2020-is-outdated}, in cases where it makes sense and where it doesn't. While for investors this can be a huge opportunity, these devices open a very big attack surface and implementing the fog architecture can make things a lot easier. Chiang is naming 5 different main challenges \cite[s. 855 ff.]{DBLP:journals/iotj/ChiangZ16}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item [A] Stringent Latency Requirements: Control systems require latencies between sensor and control node to be within few milliseconds. Some even within tens of a millisecond.
	\item [B] Network Bandwidth Constraints: Large amount of data generated are generated by sensors(e.g.: up to one gigabyte per second for an autonomous car) causing requiring high bandwidth if sent to the cloud.
	\item [C] Resource-Constrained Devices: IoT devices and micro-controllers often have only the resources they need to work. Everyone of them communicating directly with the cloud will cause a lot of overhead.
	\item [D] Cyber Physical Systems: Cyber-physical systems are often required to be online all the time, especially in safety-critical areas.
	\item [E] Uninterrupted Services With Intermittent Connectivity to the Cloud: Functionality of a system has to be working even without network connectivity.
    \item [F] New Security Challenges:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1)] Keeping Security Credentials and Software up to Date on Large Number of Devices.
		\item[2)] Protecting Resource-Constrained Devices.
		\item[3)] Assessing the Security Status of Large Distributed Systems in Trustworthy Manner.
		\item[4)] Responding to Security Compromises Without Causing Intolerable Disruptions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
