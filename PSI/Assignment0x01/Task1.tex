\paragraph{General}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Don't store passwords in plain text, but checksums/hashes.
	\item Balance ease of use with challenge.
	\item Regularly revalidate information
	\item Minimum time between successful login and recovery
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Email Authentication}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus on recovering the account - not all features
	\item Don't send their old password, but a new, randomly generated password. Or a token
	\item Notify real account holder over all channels available.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Knowledge-Based}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Don't use/allow guessed information
	\item Factor in changes over time / differences between cultures.
	\item Changes should require at least as much authority as recovery.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Social}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Don't spam or people won't take part anymore.
	\item Promising, but on the far end of the effort/securty curve.
\end{itemize}
