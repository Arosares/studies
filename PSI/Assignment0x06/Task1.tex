\section{Setting up the Environment}

As username I was very creative and chose "frank". The IP-Address is: 10.136.0.114. The VM's address is: 10.137.2.170

\section{Bypass the login}

To bypass the login we used: \verb|' or 1=1 -- |. It is important to include the whitespace after the SQL Injection. When visiting Daisy Duck's profile page, the URL changes to \verb|http://10.137.2.170/index.php?page=profile&userid=6|. So now we know the userid of Daisy Duck is 6.

To successfully login as Daisy we used the injection: \verb|' or id=6 -- |.


And unfortunately we didn't have enough time to proceed this Assignment this week.
