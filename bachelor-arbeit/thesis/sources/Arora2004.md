Arora performs an emprical study on the effects of vulnerability disclosure on the frequency of attacks and how quickly the vulnerability is patched.
The study is performed only on data collected from honeypot systems.
The findings of the study are that vulnerability disclosure increases the number of attacks, while the availability of patches reduces the number of attacks.
Instantaneous disclosure increases the probability of vendors fixing vulnerabilities and vendors are more likely to patch faster.
Also open source vendors patch faster in general, large vendors are more responsive to disclosed vulnerabilities.
Vendors are also more responsive, if the vulnerability is more severe.
