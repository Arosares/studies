Arora provides a *mathematical* framework for chosing the optimal disclosure policy.

Assumes that neither full vendor disclosure, nor immediate public disclosure are optimal.
Questions how long the vendor should be allowed to keep a vulnerability secret.

Vendors will release a patch earlier, if the internalized customer losses are greater.
Larger internalized customer losses also make the vendor more sensitive to the vulnerability.
This also gives the social planner (eg. CERT/CC) a greater leverage on the vendor, forcing them to release a patch on time.

If a workaround exists, the vendor is less likely to release a patch on time, as the customer losses are smaller.
