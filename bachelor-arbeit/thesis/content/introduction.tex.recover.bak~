\section{Introduction}



The word vulnerability origins from the Latin word vulnus, or ``wound''. If a human is wounded, it is quite obvious to see a doctor, but if a computer is wounded, nobody might even notice. Therefore, whenever someone encounters a ``wound'', they should disclose it to the corresponding authorities to provide a patch. Similar to our health care system, where many parties need to work together to ensure the patient's health, it is important that software vendors cooperate with researchers, academics, penetration testers or any user of their product to improve their software's security.

%Everyday more and more software based devices are built and distributed in our environment. While they provide useful services or are just very convenient, every one could contain a flaw, allowing adversaries to break into such devices and steal valuable, private information. Therefore it is of greatest importance that software vendors work together with researchers, academics, penetration testers or any user of their product to improve its software security. Since computers became dominant in our lives, different ways to disclose vulnerabilities have emerged. 

In this thesis a tool is developed to analyze model-based software in order to estimate a test cost. In the process three different approaches emerged. The Halstead Software Metrics \autoref{sec:approach-halstead}, McCabe's cyclomatic complexity \autoref{sec:} and a newly introduced custom approach. Tp evaluate all approaches experts reviewed the model-based software, grading it on a scale from 0 to 10 according to its complexity to understand.

In this paper we introduce three different types of disclosure (\autoref{sec:types_disclosure}) after we establish the terminology in \autoref{sec:vuln_background}. In \autoref{sec:guide} we present a guide for coordinated vulnerability disclosure from the perspective of the discoverer of the vulnerability. We proceed with a short comparison between open source and closed source software vendors in terms of disclosure (\autoref{sec:open_vs_prop}) and provide several incentives and risks for disclosure in \autoref{sec:risks_incentives}. Lastly we give some examples of vulnerability disclosure happened in recent times in \autoref{sec:examples}.

%"Vulnerability disclosure is a process through which vendors and vulnerability finders may work

%resolution." \cite{ISO29147:2014}

%Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know. – Donald Rumsfeld
