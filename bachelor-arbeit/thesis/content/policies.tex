\section{Types of Disclosure}\label{sec:types_disclosure}
%Pros and cons; Effectiveness
This section gives an overview of the different disclosure policies and is ordered by evolution over time \cite{Cavusoglu2007}. While in the early days of software systems, the full vendor disclosure was preferred, the immediate public disclosure got more popular as more and more vulnerabilities were left unpatched. However, it was soon realized that this is also not the optimal way of handling the issue. Today the hybrid disclosure is most commonly used, because it is the most beneficial to society while being fair for software vendors.
