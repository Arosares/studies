\section{Introduction}


Quality control in software development is a fundamental step to a reliable product. Especially in safety critical area, software is not allowed to malfunction. However, the longer tests take, the more expensive the products get. If you know the test cost of your product, you can coordinate man hours in the most effective way, minimizing costs while keeping the quality high.

In this thesis a tool is developed to analyze model-based software in order to estimate a test cost. In the process three different approaches emerged. The Halstead Software Metrics \autoref{sec:approach-halstead}, McCabe's cyclomatic complexity \autoref{sec:approach-cyclomatic} and a newly introduced custom approach \autoref{sec:approach-sda}. Tp evaluate all approaches experts reviewed the model-based software, grading it on a scale from 0 to 10 according to its complexity to understand \autoref{sec:eval}.
