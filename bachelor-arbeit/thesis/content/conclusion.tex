\section{Conclusion}



In this thesis three different approaches to estimate the test cost of model-based embedded software, the Halsted metric, McCabe's cyclomatic complexity  and a newly introduced solution tailored to system specifics were implemented and then evaluated with the estimations of experts that test the software everyday. Halstead's software metric for the difficulty to understand software was in an overwhelming amount of cases the closest to the experts estimation. Though that does not mean the other metrics are bad, just that they are designed give more weight on different specifics.
