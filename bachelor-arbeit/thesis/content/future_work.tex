\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Integrating into Toolchain}

The sbtSWAT functionality shall be integrated into the current tool in use that allows test automation.

\subsection{Time Cost Estimation}

One of the reasons the test cost of software is established, is to help planning the test order. If a reasonable time frame can be derived without having to examing the software, project planners will have a easier time meeting the deadline to a software release. In order to achieve a good time estimation, the time needed for every function group needs to be noted and put in relation to the estimated complexity values.
