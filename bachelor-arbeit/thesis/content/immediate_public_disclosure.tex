\subsection{Immediate Public Disclosure}
\label{sec:immediate-public}

In contrast to a full vendor disclosure, the immediate public disclosure results in more pressure on the vendor to release a patch as soon as possible after the finding of a vulnerability \cite{Cavusoglu2007}. Additionally, affected service providers that use the vulnerable software have the possibility to limit the effect of the vulnerability through additional security measures. However, Bilge and Dumitra\c{s} found that after public disclosure, attacks using that vulnerability increased by up to five orders of magnitude, leaving every user at a higher risk \cite{Bilge:2012:BWK:2382196.2382284}.
